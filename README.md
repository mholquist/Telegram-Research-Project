# Telegram Research Project
## Context & Objective:
These files are part of an ongoing research project with a CMU professor. The first part of the project involved scraping Russian and Ukrainian Telegram 
channels to build out a dataset of their posts (which is what the code in this repository pertains to). In the end, this dataset will be used to develop an NLP model for classifying misinformation related to the 
Russian-Ukranian war. Because this is an ongoing project, the final dataset is not included, but the scraping file, data cleaning file, and data dictionary for the final dataset are included.
